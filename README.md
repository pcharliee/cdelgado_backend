# Proyecto Backend - Coderhouse

The main focus of this project is the backend. However, I've also created an `EXTREMELY` simple frontend to try out some of the endpoints.

After downloading the project, go to the app folder and run `npm install` and then `npm run start` to get the frontend proyect started.

Thanks for dropping by ðŸ˜œ
